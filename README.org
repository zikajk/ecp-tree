** Introduction
*Eglot Clojure Project Tree* uses custom functionality in clojure-lsp. Lsp-mode has treemacs integration, this is for people who for some reason decided to use eglot instead of lsp-mode.

This is an interactive project tree for Clojure projects. It facilitates the navigation and interaction with various project entities like files, namespaces, and functions directly from Emacs.

** Installation

*** Installation

**** Prerequisites

Ensure you have Emacs version 29.1 or newer installed. The following dependencies are handled automatically:

- Eglot 1.12.29 (built into Emacs 29.1)
- Hierarchy 0.7.0 (built into Emacs 29.1)
- Jarchive 0.11.0

**** Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   git clone https://github.com/zikajk/ecp-tree.git ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/ecp-tree
   #+END_SRC

2. Add to your Emacs configuration:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/ecp-tree")
   (require 'ecp-tree)
   #+END_SRC

** Usage

There are two main commands:

*** Display Full Project Tree
To display the complete project tree:

#+BEGIN_SRC
M-x ecp-tree-show
#+END_SRC

*** Display Current Namespace Tree
To display the tree starting from your current namespace:

#+BEGIN_SRC
M-x ecp-tree-show-from-current
#+END_SRC

This will show only the current namespace and its contents.

*** Show Callers for var / fn
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       58BE3373-0216-4208-9B99-D28986EFF07C
:END:
Number of callers next to each fn / var:

*** Debug Mode
To debug potential problems during hierarchy creation:

#+BEGIN_SRC
M-x ecp-tree-toggle-debug
#+END_SRC

** Configuration

Can be customized by:

- =(customize-group ecp-tree)=

ECP-Tree offers several customization options to adjust the appearance and behavior of the project tree. These include:

- Icon (string) for different node types like projects, folders, libraries, etc.
- Sorting children nodes alphabetically.

Refer to the package source for detailed customization options and their default values.

If ~.jar~ file nodes under 'External Dependencies' are missing children (such as ~.clj~ and ~.class~ files), you might need to add this to your =~/.config/clojure-lsp/config.edn=

#+begin_example
{....
 :dependency-scheme "jar"
...}
#+end_example

** Development

The ECP-Tree is developed and maintained by zikajk. For contributions, suggestions, or issues, please visit the project's GitHub repository:

- URL: http://github.com/zikajk/ecp-tree

*** Current Features

- Interactive project tree view.
- Customizable icons (strings) for different node types.
- Sorting of children nodes.

*** Future Developments

- [ ] Class Decompilation: Currently, ECP-Tree does not integrate class decompilation. It is a potential area for development, possibly leveraging existing clojure-lsp functionality. Contributions are welcome to implement this feature.

- [x] Lazy and Asynchronous Hierarchy Loading: Improving the project tree's responsiveness by finding ways to load the hierarchy lazily and possibly asynchronously, so users don't have to wait for the full hierarchy to build at once.

- +Cache Mechanism Improvements: The current cache mechanism is quite naive. Enhancing this could improve performance.+
  /Versions >=0.2 don't need cache anymore as they load their children lazily!/
