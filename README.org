** Introduction
*Eglot Clojure Project Tree* uses custom functionality in clojure-lsp. Lsp-mode has treemacs integration, this is for people who for some reason decided to use eglot instead of lsp-mode.

This is an interactive project tree for Clojure projects. It facilitates the navigation and interaction with various project entities like files, namespaces, and functions directly from Emacs.

** Installation

To use ECP-Tree, ensure you have Emacs version 29.1 or newer installed, along with the Eglot and Hierarchy packages. Here's the minimum Emacs and package versions required:

- Emacs 29.1
- Eglot 1.12.29
- Hierarchy 0.7.0
- Jarchive 0.11.0

Load the =ecp-tree.el= file into your Emacs and require it by adding the following line to your Emacs configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'ecp-tree)
#+END_SRC

** Usage

To display the project tree, execute:

#+BEGIN_SRC
M-x ecp-tree-show
#+END_SRC

To debug potentional problems during a hierarchy creation, use:

#+BEGIN_SRC
M-x ecp-tree-toggle-debug
#+END_SRC

** Configuration

Can be customized by:

- =(customize-group ecp-tree)=

ECP-Tree offers several customization options to adjust the appearance and behavior of the project tree. These include:

- Icon (string) for different node types like projects, folders, libraries, etc.
- Enabling or disabling caching for node's children to improve performance.
- Sorting children nodes alphabetically.

Refer to the package source for detailed customization options and their default values.

If ~.jar~ file nodes under 'External Dependencies' are missing children (such as ~.clj~ and ~.class~ files), you might need to add this to your =~/.config/clojure-lsp/config.edn=

#+begin_example
{....
 :dependency-scheme "jar"
...}
#+end_example

** Development

The ECP-Tree is developed and maintained by zikajk. For contributions, suggestions, or issues, please visit the project's GitHub repository:

- URL: http://github.com/zikajk/ecp-tree

*** Current Features

- Interactive project tree view.
- Customizable icons (strings) for different node types.
- Performance optimizations through optional caching.
- Sorting of children nodes.

*** Future Developments

- [ ] Class Decompilation: Currently, ECP-Tree does not integrate class decompilation. It is a potential area for development, possibly leveraging existing clojure-lsp functionality. Contributions are welcome to implement this feature.

- [x] Lazy and Asynchronous Hierarchy Loading: Improving the project tree's responsiveness by finding ways to load the hierarchy lazily and possibly asynchronously, so users don't have to wait for the full hierarchy to build at once.

- +Cache Mechanism Improvements: The current cache mechanism is quite naive. Enhancing this could improve performance.+
  /Versions >=0.2 don't need cache anymore as they load their children lazily!/
